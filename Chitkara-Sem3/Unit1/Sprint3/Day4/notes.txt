Spare Matrix
    2D array where most of the elements are zero(or a default value). So special representations
    are used to store only non-zero elements.
    1. Memory Efficient

    | 1 0 0 0 |

    | 0 3 0 0 | 4x4 Sparse Matrix
    if (row*col/2) > 0 ---> Sparse Matrix ,i.e. more than half the elements are zero


TYPES OF SPARSE MATRICES REPRESENTATIONS
    1. Coordinate List -  COO
    2. Compressed row - CSR
    3. Compressed Spare Column - CSC

COORDINATE LIST (COO)
    1. Triplets(row,col,value)
    2. Easy to construct
    3. Good for storing and converting
    In COO format, we store only non-zero values along with their row and col indices in a separate structure
    COO_matrix [non-zero elements][3]

COMPRESSED ROW (CSR)
    1. Three Arrays
        a. values[]
        b. columnIndex[]
        c. rowPointer[]
