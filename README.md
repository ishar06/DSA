## 📌 Overview

This repository contains my **Data Structures & Algorithms implementations in C++**, developed alongside my **3rd Semester academic curriculum** and reinforced through **regular post-class practice**.

The goal is not just to implement DSA concepts, but to **understand trade-offs, optimize performance, and write clean, interview-ready C++ code**.

> 🎯 Designed for **FAANG-style interviews**, strong CS fundamentals, and real-world problem solving.

---

## 🧠 What People Will Find Here

✔️ Clear understanding of **core DSA concepts**  
✔️ Strong grip on **time & space complexity analysis**  
✔️ Clean, readable, well-structured C++ code  
✔️ Academic learning translated into **practical implementations**  
✔️ Consistency, discipline, and problem-solving mindset
